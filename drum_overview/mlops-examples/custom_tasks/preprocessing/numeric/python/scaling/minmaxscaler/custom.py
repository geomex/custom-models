    Parameters
    -------
    X: pd.DataFrame
        Training data that DataRobot passes when this task is being trained.
    y: pd.Series
        Project's target column (None is passed for unsupervised projects).
    output_dir: str
        A path to the output folder; the artifact [in this example - containing a power transformer] must be saved into this folder to be re-used in transform().

    Returns
    -------
    None
        fit() doesn't return anything, but must output an artifact (typically containing a trained object) into output_dir
        so that the trained object can be used during scoring inside transform()
