# Boston Housing Example

This folder includes an example of how to use DRUM with different custom models.

You can use Google Colab to follow along with `Main_Script.ipynb`.

In this notebook you will:

* build a Random Forest Regression model using sklearn
* use DRUM to score data in batch
* use DRUM to test if the model can handle missing values
* use DRUM to serve the model as a rest endpoint
* show how easy it is to swap out models (also built on Boston data)
* lastly, with a DatRobot account, register and monitor the model (if needed, you can use a [DataRobot trial](https://www.datarobot.com/trial/) account)
